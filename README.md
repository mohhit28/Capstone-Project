# Capstone-Project
Project Description for GitHub Repository: Bike Ride Analysis
This repository contains a detailed dataset and codebase for analyzing bike-sharing rides. With over 337,000 entries, the dataset provides comprehensive insights into ride patterns, station usage, and user types, ideal for exploring urban mobility and transportation trends.

# Key Features of the Dataset:
Ride Information: Includes unique ride IDs, ride types (e.g., electric or manual bikes), and timestamps for start and end times.

Station Data: Covers start and end station names, IDs, and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

User Categories: Differentiates between "member" and "casual" user types for behavioral analysis.

# Analysis Goals:
Ride Pattern Exploration: Analyze peak usage times, station popularity, and ride durations.

User Behavior Insights: Understand differences between members and casual users.

Geographic Mapping: Visualize ride start and end points to highlight high-demand areas.

Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to forecast usage trends or optimize station placements.

# Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn

Data Storage: CSV files for ease of use

Visualization Tools: Power BI or Tableau for advanced data presentations

#Usage:
This project is perfect for data science enthusiasts looking to practice skills in data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. It offers a real-world dataset to delve into transportation analytics and machine learning.
